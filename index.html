                <p class="quote-part light-black">"Human beings are born with limitless potential, creativity, and imagination. A job is too small a space to contain the vastness of our abilities. The traditional idea of employment restricts innovation, as we focus on fulfilling someone else's vision rather than our own. I believe we are all entrepreneurs at heart, capable of solving problems, building businesses, and transforming the world around us. We don’t have to wait for others to create opportunities for us. Instead, we must unlock our potential, think differently, and create opportunities for ourselves and others. That’s how real change happens."</p>
